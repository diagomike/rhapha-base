<p><strong>…our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ (1 John 1:3).</strong></p>
<p>Ask many people, “Why did Jesus come?” They’ll mostly answer, “He came to save us from sin,” or “He came to destroy the works of the devil.” But Jesus came to do much more than “save” us from sin, and destroy the works of the devil; all that was a means to an end. He came for a much higher purpose.</p>
<p>In John 10:10 AMPC, for example, He said, <em>“...I came that they may have and enjoy life, and have it in abundance (to the full, till it overflows).”</em> So, Jesus came to give us life, but again, that’s one of the stated purposes. 1 Corinthians 1:9 says, <em>“God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.”</em> This is so powerful, and it consummates His purpose for coming. </p>
<p>If He only saved us or destroyed the works of the devil or gave us life, without bringing us into fellowship or oneness with Himself and with the Father, all the foregoing would have never been enough. </p>
<p>He saved us from sin, and gave us His life, to make it possible for us to become one with the Father; He brought us into fellowship—the fellowship of the God-kind. This is the amazing blessing that Jesus brought to us—the big thing that He made possible—<a href="http://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fellowship</a> with the Father. Now, anything that belongs to the Father belongs to us; we’re heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ. Glory to God!</p>

<p><strong>But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit (1 Corinthians 6:17).</strong></p>
<p>A great number of Christians know that Jesus was crucified and died as our Saviour, but they don’t know about, or understand, our divine fellowship with Him. When we talk about fellowship, what comes to their minds is when we come together in a church meeting to discuss the Word and to praise and worship the Lord. Fellowship, however, means more than that.</p>
<p>Essentially, our fellowship with the Lord describes our oneness or union with Him; something deeper than an association; such oneness that’s greater than a covenant. You can have a covenant without fellowship. The Lord Jesus brought us into such fellowship with Himself, where He sees Himself in us; He’s never satisfied until we’re satisfied; He derives His joy from our joy. Such blessed relationship! Now we can walk with Him, talk with Him, and live in Him as well as in His Name.</p>
<p>If you’re not living with the consciousness of the full blessings of your divine fellowship with the Lord, you’re missing too much! Become conscious, and take advantage of your oneness with the Lord.</p>
<p>Paul, writing to Timothy, said, <em>“…be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus”</em> (2 Timothy 2:1); take advantage of the grace that’s in Christ Jesus. There’s an abundance of grace in Christ Jesus. If only many understood the immensity, infinitude, and unconditional nature of His love for us! We’re to take advantage of His grace and love in our <a href="http://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fellowship</a> with Him.</p>
<p>1 John 3:1-2 says, <em>“Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God….”</em> You need to know that God truly loves you, and take full advantage of His love. When you know, and are convinced of His love for you, it’ll be inconceivable to think He’ll be indifferent to your prayer or not answer you. Therefore, when you pray, be confident to expect an answer from Him, and walk in continual victory daily, and in every place.</p>

<p><strong>I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live (Deuteronomy 30:19)</strong></p>
<p>In life, the choices we make are so important, as they can make or mar our destinies. Take for instance, the story of Elimelech, his wife Naomi, and his two sons, Mahlon and Chilion. They had relocated from BethlehemJudah to Moab, because of famine. However, as time went by, the man and his two sons, who were now also married, passed away. </p>
<p>Following their demise, Naomi decided to return to her hometown, BethlehemJudah, but the two wives of her sons, Ruth and Orpah insisted they’d follow her, but Naomi wouldn’t let them. She gave them legitimate reasons to return to their own mothers’ houses (read entire account in Ruth 1:1-16). Orpah eventually chose to return to her people, but Ruth made the decision to abide with Naomi, and she went with her to Bethlehem Judah. </p>
<p>Both Ruth and Orpah genuinely loved Naomi and wanted to stay with her, but here was a decision point in their lives. When Orpah turned away from Naomi and went back to her people, her life and destiny changed completely from that moment. Jewish history gives a detailed record of how she eventually became the mother of Goliath, the Philistine giant of Gath, who was slain by David. </p>
<p>The question then would be, why would Ruth choose rather to stay with Naomi, when the “sensible” thing to have done was to go back and start her life afresh, as Orpah did? It was about the worship of God, and the life of faith she had seen with Naomi; that’s what she didn’t want to give up. Her choice paid off, because she would later marry a relative of Elimelech, by the name of Boaz. Boaz became the father of Jesse, who became the father of David, the lineage from where Christ came.</p>
<p>No one is ever a fool for trusting the Lord and choosing the way of the Spirit. Like Ruth, always choose right; choose the way of the Spirit, and not that which seems right, practical, and sensible in the sight of men.</p>

<p><strong>After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, this cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me (1 Corinthians 11:25).</strong></p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus gave Himself for us, it wasn’t just the blood of a natural man that was shed, because His life didn’t come from the first Adam; His life came from the Word (John 1:14 NKJV). His life was divine; His shed blood was divine; He gave up His divine life for us. So, when He said, <em>“…this cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me”</em> (1 Corinthians 11:25), He meant that all the provisions of the New Testament are sealed in, and guaranteed by, His blood.</p>
<p>Your life and your future have a guarantee in the blood of Jesus. In your life, all the provisions of His vicarious death, burial, and resurrection, have become a reality. There’s nothing in life that you could ever want that His blood doesn’t cover. That’s why the Spirit, through the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 3:21, declares unequivocally, <em>“...all things are yours.”</em> Hallelujah!  </p>
<p>He’s given you strength, wisdom, courage, health, and so much more. He’s taken everything of darkness away from you, and translated you into His marvellous <a href="http://pcdl.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">light.</a> Your riddance; your severance from darkness to light, from the pains, misery, and negativities of life—into the glorious kingdom of His love-Son—was through His blood. Colossians 1:13-14 says He <em>“…hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins.”</em></p>
<p>You’re guaranteed to succeed; you’re a victor for life; your prosperity is guaranteed. Have this consciousness when you partake of the Communion, or whenever you drink the cup. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>According to our theme scripture, Jesus Christ existed with God in the beginning as the Word. He’s the creator and maker of all things. John tells us, <em>“All things were made by him; and without him was not</em> <em>any thing</em> <em>made that was made”</em> (John 1:3). You’d notice, he didn’t say, “All things were made by IT”; he used the personal pronoun “him,” because the Word is a Person. The Word is God.</p>
<p>In Genesis 1, the Bible shows that God brought creation into being by His spoken Word. He spoke words, and they materialised. Now, John, talking about the Word, tells us that God made all things by the Word, meaning He made all things by Himself. John 1:14 NKJV says, <em>“And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us….”</em> <a href="http://pcdl.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Word</a>, which is God, became flesh in the person of Jesus, and dwelt among us. </p>
<p>Matthew 1:23 says, <em>“…they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.”</em> And then 1 Timothy 3:16 declares, <em>“...God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.”</em> This brings all arguments to rest about the divinity of Christ: without a doubt, Jesus Christ is God! He’s God manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, and received up in glory.</p>
<p>Someone might say, “But isn’t Jesus the Son of God?” Yes! “Son of God” means God in the flesh. Recall the reaction of the Jews when He said to them, “I am the Son of God” (John 5:17-18); they picked up stones to stone Him to death; they were furious. They said, “How dare you, a man, make yourself equal with God by saying you’re the Son of God?” (John 10:33). They understood perfectly what He meant; He wasn’t merely referring to being born of God as God’s offspring. He meant He’s Himself, God! </p>
<p>Until you know and believe this about Jesus, you really can’t walk with Him; your faith in Him will be weak and ineffective. John tells us, “The word became flesh,” and Paul says the same thing: “God was manifest in the flesh”; that’s Jesus! Glory to His Name forever! </p>

<p><strong>Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord (Romans 12:11).</strong></p>
<p>As Christians, our participation and involvement in the Gospel, our passion for its spread around the world, must be indomitable; it’s the reason we’re here on earth; it’s what we live for! One sure way to know a Christian who’s working with the Spirit, and walking in the Spirit, is his or her unyielding, undying passion for the spread of the Gospel.</p>
<p>God’s vision is the evangelisation and Christianisation of the world. He wants the whole earth filled with the knowledge of His glory, as the waters cover the sea. That’s where we come in; we’re His partners in soul winning; we’re the ones to establish His will, and His Kingdom in the earth and in the hearts of men.</p>
<p>God has called you and given you a divine mandate; stay focused and committed to that calling. He said in Mark 16:15, <em>“…Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.”</em> The Lord Jesus, here, wasn’t only instructing Peter, James, John, and the other disciples; He was talking to you and me. Moreover, He’s coming soon, and when He comes back, He’s only going to be interested in your life in Him, and the impact you made with the Gospel.</p>
<p>What are you doing with your life? How are you affecting others with the Gospel, the message of Jesus? Remember, He came to this world to give His life so that men may live, and come into union with God. Therefore, the only way we can truly share His love is to passionately take His message to the world, and tell them about the blood Jesus shed, not only for the remission of sins, but to give eternal life to all men, and make it possible for us to become sons of God.</p>
<p>I urge you to be fervent in soul winning; be active in the house of God; be about the Father’s business. Run with His vision that’s in your heart. Our opening verse in the Moffat NT Version says, <em>“never let your zeal flag; maintain the spiritual glow; serve the Lord.”</em> Be afire for, and with, <a href="https://rhapsodybible.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Gospel.</a></p>

<p>I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit (John 15:1-2).</p>
<p>Proverbs 11:30 says, <em>“…he that winneth souls</em> <em>is</em> <em>wise.”</em> A soul winner is wise because he’s aligned to God’s number one passion, the passion to turn men from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God. Therefore, if you’ve been a soul winner, God has a plan to give you greater capacity to win more souls.</p>
<p>That’s the point the Master highlights in our opening verse, when He says, <em>“…every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.”</em> What this means is that as a branch that produces fruits, the Father has a plan for your capacity building, to make you even more productive. He increases the grace on your life to achieve more. </p>
<p>For example, if you have grace to win and retain thirty souls in your fellowship, cell group, or church, it doesn’t matter what you do to increase, you may not exceed that number. Your effectiveness and productivity in any assignment would be to the extent of the grace granted you to function or carry out that assignment. For you to do more, the Lord will have to give you more grace; the Bible says, <em>“But he giveth more grace...”</em> (James 4:6); that additional grace takes you to a higher level. </p>
<p>Suddenly, you discover that you’re able to do more than you hitherto could; you’re more efficient; you put in the same efforts as you used to, but your results are greater. This is why it’s so important that we remain in constant fellowship with the Lord as we serve Him. Grace is increased as we know the Lord more, through the ministry of the Spirit and the Word. </p>
<p>2 Peter 1:2 says, <em>“Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord.”</em> This is your sure guarantee to a fruitful and productive life.</p>

<p><strong>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life (John 6:47).</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, people confuse faith with believing. Both concepts are actually related, and they work together, but they’re not the same. Faith is translated from the Greek word “pistis,” which is a noun, while believe, on the other hand, is “pisteuoÌ„,” a verb which means to demonstrate your faith, to act your faith. </p>
<p>When you say you “believe,” it’s not passive but active; there’s action to it. “Believing” is a word of action; it’s actually “doing” your faith. So, when we say we’re “believers” in Jesus, it means we’re doers of the Word; we’re Word practitioners. That’s why the Bible says, <em>“Even so</em> <em>faith,</em> <em>if it hath not works, is dead, being alone”</em> (James 2:17). Faith requires a corresponding action; you prove your faith by your actions; that’s believing. </p>
<p>The Apostle James explained the difference between faith without actions, and faith with actions. Faith without actions is dead, but faith with actions produces results. He says, <em>“Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works”</em> (James 2:18). What he explains here is the simple word “Believe.” If I say, “I believe in Jesus Christ,” it means I do my faith; whatever it is that I believe about Jesus is revealed in my actions; I’m talking it; I’m walking it. I’m acting it. Hallelujah! </p>
<p>Understanding the relationship between faith and believing is very important, because they’re fundamental to your possessing and enjoying other blessings of the Gospel. Believing is faith and corresponding action put together. You must act your faith as a believer in Jesus Christ. Your faith calls the unseen into manifestation. With your faith, you see and create the invisible and make impossible things possible. Praise God!</p>

<p><strong>That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord (Romans 5:21).</strong></p>
<p>Righteousness is the nature of God in you that produces the ability to stand before God without guilt, inferiority, or condemnation. Righteousness is the outworking of divine grace, granting acceptance, liberty, and rights to the human spirit in the presence of God. So, the grace of God has given us this righteousness; that’s what we read in our opening verse.</p>
<p>Our righteousness is God’s gift to us in Christ Jesus, because of His grace. By grace, we received God’s nature of righteousness and were translated into the Kingdom of His Love-Son, where we reign and rule with Him. John 1:17 says, “For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.” Romans 5:17 says, “…they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>Not only do we have dominion over the devil and circumstances, we live in the righteousness of God, and live as the righteousness of God. Nothing, and no one, can condemn us anymore, because God has justified us; He’s acquitted us, and it was righteous for Him to do this for us: “To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus” (Romans 3:26). </p>
<p>It’s your responsibility to take a hold of your righteousness; that is, to become righteousnessconscious and exercise dominion over Satan, the world, and all circumstances. Righteousness-consciousness gives you that boldness and confidence to pray and expect answers. It gives you mastery over demons and their manipulations. It makes you a champion in life! </p>
<p>It really doesn’t matter where you’ve been, what you’ve done, or who you’ve been; you’re now accepted in Christ Jesus (Ephesians 1:6). Now, in His presence, you’re at liberty; you don’t have to be afraid anymore; you’re free to express yourself and to be yourself, unashamed before Him.

<p><strong>But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking (Matthew 6:7).</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, you find Christians who say, “I need powerful prayers; so please, pray a powerful prayer for me.” But what’s a powerful prayer anyway? What makes a prayer powerful? Is it the loudness of the voice of the one praying, or is it because they’re speaking religious words? Well, what you need isn’t a “powerful” prayer, but a simple prayer to a powerful God.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus, in our opening verse, said that when you pray, you shouldn’t act like the heathen who use vain, repetitive words. They erroneously think they’ll be heard for their much speaking; Jesus said we shouldn’t pray like that. Read His words: “Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him” (Matthew 6:8).</p>
<p>Learn to <a href="http://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pray</a> like Jesus; He prayed and acted simply. Imagine the simple way He prayed at the tomb of Lazarus. The Bible says, “…And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me. And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth” (John 11:41-43). </p>
<p>What makes prayer work is faith, and not the multitude or multiplicity of words. Jesus made this very clear in Mark 11:24: “Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.” Therefore, make your prayers simple; pray with faith, and avoid vain repetitions. </p>
<p>When you pray in other tongues, your spirit, by the Holy Spirit, prays according to the will of God. That’s primarily the way you ought to pray as a Christian: pray with the spirit first; that is, in tongues, before you pray with your understanding, your natural earthly language. “What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also” (1 Corinthians 14:15).</p>

<p><strong>Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think</strong> <strong>any thing</strong> <strong>as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God (2 Corinthians 3:5).</strong></p>
<p>2 Corinthians 4:7 says, <em>“But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.”</em> The power at work in you is divine; it’s got nothing to do with how physically endowed or naturally intelligent you are. The reason you can do anything, be anything, and prosper in whatever you do is the ability of Christ in you. He’s the power at work in you. Philippians 2:13 says, <em>“For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.”</em></p>
<p>Therefore, when circumstances place a demand on you, don’t say, “I’m not sure I can do this,” even if it’s something for which you think you’re not naturally able; by the Holy Ghost, you can do all things! Become conscious of this reality. Always declare, “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.” Christ in you is your strength for success in any endeavour, and your assurance of victory in the face of adversities. </p>
<p>Christ in you is everything! His presence in you makes you supernatural; He strengthens you with might in your inner man; that means no weakness in your life. Before you received the Holy Spirit, you may have been weak and timid, easily discouraged, but now you’re turned on from within by His divine power! You’re bold and courageous, audacious in faith, with power over crises. </p>
<p>Become conscious that you’re not alone; 1 John 4:4 says, <em>“Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in</em> <em>you,</em> <em>than he that is in the world.”</em> No matter the challenges you might face in life, you can chew them up; you have Christ’s ability to face whatever comes out against you and win. When you face oppositions, you’re not to rely on or boast in your human ability, but in the life of <a href="https://www.christembassy.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christ</a> within.</p>
<p>Make up your mind to live triumphantly every day, and do big things for the Lord, for He’s granted you the ability of Christ.</p>

<p><strong>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves (James 1:22).</strong></p>
<p>The Christian who’s come to spiritual maturity is always quick to act on the Word; he doesn’t question or try to rationalise God’s Word or His instructions; he simply takes the required actions. That’s where the blessing really is: acting on the Word. As we read in our opening verse, it’s the doers of the Word that please the Father, not those who hear, and do nothing. As long as it’s <a href="http://bit.ly/rhapsodycompendium" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">His Word</a>, be quick and willing to act. </p>
<p>In the New Testament, God doesn’t have to convince us to obey His voice or do His Word, because we live the Word. Like Abraham, we’ve come to trust Him, because we’re acquainted with Him through fellowship. Abraham is, for us, an example of one who greatly esteemed God’s instructions. In Genesis 22:2, the Lord said to him, <em>“...Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.”</em></p>
<p>As tough as this instruction was, Abraham didn’t question it; he acted accordingly and would have sacrificed his son, had the Lord not stopped him. His motivation was simple: God said to do it, and that’s it! This should be your attitude to the Word always. Your pleasure and delight should be in doing the things the Lord said to do. His instruction to you may seem unpleasant or illogical, but be wise and do what He says, because God’s “foolishness” is wiser than man’s wisdom.</p>
<p>If you’re about to make a decision and the Word of God reveals something different, don’t harden your heart; go with the Word. God’s Word will always show you the “more excellent” way. Yield yourself completely to the lordship of the Word, and watch the Word mould, correct, transform, and position you for greatness, and fulfil His destiny for your life. </p>

<p><strong>For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps (1 Peter 2:21).</strong></p>
<p>The Lord Jesus, in His earth-walk, led an exemplary life. Not only was He a phenomenal intrusion into the sense realm, He was extraordinary in all facets. He was never in want; He had no consciousness of need; He was always in charge of situations and circumstances. He was a marvel, to say the least. He used words like no one ever did. </p>
<p>There isn’t a more perfect example for us to emulate than Jesus. He exercised absolute mastery over circumstances; never flustered or ruffled by anything. Every word He spoke came to pass. Once, He was in a boat with His disciples and they heard Him talk to the boisterous winds and waves. Prior to that time, they had heard Him talk to a tree, and the tree withered from its roots. He talked to blind eyes, and to lame legs, they all heard and obeyed Him. No wonder they asked in utter bewilderment, “What manner of man is this?”</p>
<p>Well, I’ll tell you the manner of man Jesus is: He heads up the new creation. 2 Corinthians 5:17 says if any man be in Christ, he’s a new creature; a new kind of man; this new kind of man is like Jesus. We’re of the same stock. 1 John 4:17 says, <strong>“…as he is, so are we in this world.”</strong> This is the reason we can emulate Him. Our theme scripture tells us to follow His steps; in other words, follow His examples, because as He is, so are we. He said in Mark 11:23, “You shall have what you say.” Hallelujah! </p>
<p>Practise this even now: command any boisterous wind and wave that may be billowing against your finances, your job, your academics, family, <a href="https://www.christembassy.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ministry</a>, etc., to cease. Speak to diabetes to be healed; tell that cancerous growth to dematerialise. Like Jesus, you can talk to anything and it’ll obey you. That’s the example Jesus left us with, His very steps that we have to follow. </p>

<p><strong>Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works (John 14:10).</strong></p>
<p>The Holy Spirit is the active agent of the Godhead; He’s the power of God; He carries out the acts of God. Man was created and formed by the Holy Spirit; everything God does outside of His throne is through the Holy Spirit. It’s important to understand that nothing works without the Holy Spirit; there’s no life without Him.</p>
<p>If you were tasked with an evangelical assignment in your local church, for example, until and unless, you execute it by the power of the Spirit; except He’s the one working in, and through you, it’ll be a fruitless expedition. The Bible says, <em>“For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure”</em> (Philippians 2:13); that’s referring to the Holy Spirit. No one can do God’s work without Him. The Bible says, <em>“…Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts”</em> (Zechariah 4:6). </p>
<p>Not even the Lord Jesus could do without the Holy Spirit. All the great works He did were done through the power of the Holy Spirit. We read what He said in our opening verse: <em>“…the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.”</em> If Jesus needed the Holy Spirit, it then means you can do nothing without Him. </p>
<p>No wonder God wants us to be filled with the Spirit always (Ephesians 5:18). The Holy Spirit is God at work in us, building His Church through us. Recognise Him as your helper, and you’ll function always with His ability and strength; He’ll make you a success in life and in all that you do. </p>

<p><strong>Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip (Hebrews 2:1).</strong></p>
<p>When you read our opening verse in some newer translations, it seems to suggest that it’s referring to us slipping off what we’ve learnt or have been taught. For example, the NIV says, “<em>We must pay the most careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away.”</em> Whereas, the King James Version seems to be saying we shouldn’t allow what we’ve learnt, or the <a href="http://pcdl.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">truth,</a> to slip away from us. </p>
<p>However, whether it’s you allowing the truth to slip away from you, or you’re the one drifting away from the truth, the point is, losing what you’ve learned or have been taught. If it left you, or you left it, the result will be the same. You’re supposed to be together or be one with the truth; what you’ve learnt shouldn’t leave you, and you shouldn’t drift away from it either. </p>
<p>2 Corinthians 13:5 says, <em>“Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves….”</em> In your life, are you following the direction that the Lord gave you, or are you drifting away? Are you doing the things He asked you to do? Look through the instructions you were given in the Word of God, or even in your local assembly, and be sure that you’re walking in the direction that the Lord gave you. </p>
<p>It’s important that you reflect on your life and be sure that you’re walking in sync with the Spirit; you’re following God’s plan for your life. It’s the ministry of the Holy Spirit, not only to teach you, but also to remind you of all He’s taught you. If you give Him your attention, He’ll guide you aright always; Jesus said He’ll guide you into all truth. Trust Him with your life, and He’ll lead and guide you in God’s perfect will for you.</p>

<p><strong>By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went (Hebrews 11:8).</strong></p>
<p>The Bible described Abraham as the father of faith. The Lord spoke to him to travel to an unknown destination that would become his home, and without further instructions, Abraham stepped out in faith. He didn’t question the Lord; he simply acted on the instruction.</p>
<p>Hebrews 11:9 says, <em>“By</em> <em><strong>faith</strong></em> <em>he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise.”</em> In other words, as he journeyed, wherever he pitched his tent or lived with his family at any given time, he lived unto God by faith, on the basis of what God had told him. </p>
<p>On another occasion, the Lord said to him <em>“…for a father of many nations have I made thee”</em> (Genesis 17:5). Abraham believed the Word of the Lord, even though he was still childless and all he had were his servants. Nevertheless, by the spirit of faith, he apprehended what the Lord had said, made confessions accordingly, and walked in the reality of it. </p>
<p>Galatians 3:7 tells us they that are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham; which means we’re to follow his example. Therefore, ours is a life of faith; <a href="http://pcdl.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">faith</a> is the currency by which we operate in the Kingdom. We’re creatures of faith, from a lineage of faith. The Bible says, “For we walk by faith, not by sight” (2 Corinthians 5:7). Hebrews 11:1 NLT says, <em>“What is faith? It is the confident assurance that what we hope for is going to happen. It is the evidence of things we cannot yet see.”</em></p>
<p>Faith is living according to God’s principles, trusting that He’s whom He says He is, that He’s done what He says He’s done, and that He’s given you what He says He’s given you. Faith is anchoring your life on God’s Word, refusing to be swayed to the left or to the right; it’s the title-deed to unseen realities. Blessed be God!</p>

<p><strong>For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect (Romans 4:14).</strong></p>
<p>There’re those who think they ought to be enjoying God’s blessings because they’re “living right.” Yes, by virtue of our righteousness, we’re required to live right, but to think that God ought to do certain things for you because of your good works means you’re trusting in your works; and the <a href="https://rhapsodybible.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bible</a> says, <em>“Not by works of righteousness which we have done…”</em> (Titus 3:5). </p>
<p>First, you must understand that as a Christian, God has already blessed you beyond measure; you’re blessed with ALL spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ (Ephesians 1:3). He didn’t bless you because of what you did; as a matter of fact, He blessed you ever before you knew Him. Your “good works,” as it were, won’t make Him bless you any more than He’s already done. </p>
<p>There’re some who think God will, or should hear them, because they prayed for several hours; but that’s not how it works. It’s vital to pray; prayer and other spiritual activities are highly commendable and recommended for every Christian, but don’t try to get God’s approval by doing them. What He watches out for and rewards is your faith, not works. Nonetheless, your works, if done in faith, will be pleasing to Him. </p>
<p>There’s really nothing you could ever want that isn’t already yours in Christ; everything He owns belongs to you. Thus, the anchor for your faith should be what Christ came to do. That’s what should form the basis for your believing and confession, and your trust in Him. The reason for your divine health, divine prosperity, and life of superabundance is that Christ already made them yours. Your focus should be on what He’s already done. </p>
<p>When you confess health, prosperity, victory, and all the blessings of the Gospel that are yours in Christ, it ought to be with this consciousness; the consciousness of who you are and all that’s been made available to you in Christ.</p>

<p><strong>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust (2 Peter 1:4).</strong></p>
<p>In John 6:32-33, in response to the Jews, Jesus said, <em>“…Moses gave you not that bread from</em> <em>heaven;</em> <em>but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.”</em> He emphasized this in John 6:49-50: <em>“Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.”</em> Here, He was talking about Himself; He’s the Living Bread! </p>
<p>The Word of God is the living bread which came down from heaven; the Word that became flesh. Jesus explained this in John 6:51. He said, <em>“I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man</em> <em>eat</em> <em>of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.”</em></p>
<p>Then, 1 Corinthians 10:17 reveals something powerful; it says, <em>“For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.”</em> If we’re “one bread” with Him, it therefore means we have the same life, because we’re born of the Word (1 Peter 1:23), just as Jesus is the Word made flesh (John 1:14). Colossians 1:18 says, “<em>And he (Christ) is the head of the body, the church….”</em> The life in the body isn’t different from the life in the head. He’s the head, we’re the body; the head and the body share the same life.</p>
<p>No wonder 2 Peter 1:4 says we’re associates of the God-kind; we share His life, His glory, His righteousness, His health, prosperity, strength and authority! This is what we affirm when we take the Holy Communion; it’s a celebration of our oneness with Him; we’re members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones (Ephesians 5:30). Blessed be God!</p>

<p><strong>Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth (3 John 1:2).</strong></p>
<p>1 Peter 2:24, talking about Jesus, says, <em>“Who his own</em> <em>self bare</em> <em>our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.”</em> Many Christians all over the world use this verse in acting their faith for healing, but did you know that this verse wasn’t written to Christians? It really doesn’t apply to the new creation, because Peter was writing essentially to the Jews who were scattered abroad (Read 1 Peter 1:1). </p>
<p>The new creation has the divine life, the very life of God; therefore, how could he ever be sick? However, as a spiritual babe, as one who’s still maturing in the knowledge of Christ, you may find yourself sick, and then receive healing. But the truth of the matter is, divine health is your heritage in Christ. Healing is good; it’s the children’s bread, but walking in divine health is God’s best for you; that’s the state where you don’t need healing, because you don’t get sick. </p>
<p>To some people, it’s not possible for someone to be perpetually healthy; they think it’s absurd, but that’s the life Jesus brought to us. That’s what His death, burial and resurrection accomplished for us. He was never sick. We didn’t read anywhere in the Bible that He needed to be healed; He lived in perfect health. </p>
<p>Transcend the level of needing <a href="http://enterthehealingschool.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">healing</a> from God, to living every day in divine health. This is the life of the new creation in Christ Jesus. The understanding at the babyhood stage that Jesus took your infirmities and sicknesses is good. However, beyond that is a higher level of awareness and recognition that being born again, the life of God is actually in you now; you’re a partaker of the divine nature; you have the resurrection life that’s beyond sickness and disease. This higher knowledge is what you should really study, and train yourself to live by.</p>

<p><strong>For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe (Hebrews 5:13).</strong></p>
<p>Righteousness is the nature of God that’s been imparted to our spirits that makes us like Him. This nature makes you think like Him, talk like Him, and walk like Him. Righteousness is conformity to, or with, the will and nature of God. This will and nature of God must be received, learned, or discovered through the revelation of God, or revelation from God. </p>
<p>In other words, through the Word of God, you’re trained or tutored in the word or doctrine of righteousness; you’re trained to see and think differently! 2 Timothy 3:16 says, <em>“All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.”</em> The Word of God is God’s instruction manual to train you in the way and life of righteousness. </p>
<p>Through the ministry of the Word of God, and the Holy Spirit, you’re taught how to live the Kingdom life, irrespective of your environment. With this training, you’re sagacious, exceptional, able to deal wisely and excellently in life, reigning in union with Christ. Romans 5:17 says, <em>“…they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.”</em></p>
<p>It takes understanding righteousness to reign over demons, sickness, failure, defeat, and death. It takes your understanding of righteousness to reject everything that’s not of God, and endorse only that which is consistent with His perfect will for you. It takes being skilled in the word of righteousness to think differently, see differently, and talk differently from the carnal mind, and in the light of God’s truth.</p>
<p>This is why you should constantly yield yourself to the ministry of the Word, for the <a href="http://bit.ly/rhapsodycompendium" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Word</a> is your training manual in, and for, the life of righteousness.</p>

<p><strong>But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord (2 Corinthians 3:18).</strong></p>
<p>As a child of God, His glory is in your life, and that glory is continually on the increase, as you meditate on, and live the Word. It’s one of the reasons we emphasise going to church. Every time you’re in church or in your group fellowship meetings, and you listen to the preaching and teaching of the Word of God, the glory on your life increases. As you leave the meeting, you leave with a greater glory than you came with. </p>
<p>The same happens when you study and meditate on the Word in your privacy; God’s glory in you increases. Of course, the glory of God in your spirit may not be obvious to the senses, but its impact and effects are unmistakable. The glory in us is so strong and powerful; howbeit, it’s not the same for everybody. Some Christians have more glory than others; it’s about how much of the Word of God is working in your spirit! It’s about yielding to, and living, the Word.</p>
<p>Our opening verse says, <em>“…we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.”</em> This is what the Word does in our lives: as we behold the Word, we’re metamorphosed; our glory increases. The more we meditate on the Word, the more glorious we become. </p>
<p>Even now, you’re more glorious than you were moments ago, because of your fellowship with the Word through this devotional. As you step out to your job, business, and your environment today, it’s with increased glory. Influence your world with this glory. Keep increasing the glory in you through fellowship, studying and meditating on <a href="https://rhapsodybible.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Word.</a></p>

<p>Being born again, you were born into the environment called “Christ.” Christ is a person, and Christ is also a place. So you’re in Christ; that’s your domicile; that’s where you operate from as a child of God. Now that you’re in Christ, the Holy Spirit is leading and guiding you, but that doesn’t mean there won’t be temptations on your path; lots of distractions, to try to sway you off God’s course for your life; but you must keep your focus, and refuse to be distracted.</p>
<p>In the journey of life, many things will fight for your attention. It may be financial concerns, the growing trend of infectious and medically incurable diseases, concerns about the welfare of your family, concerns about your job or business, security concerns, etc. But you must make up your mind to give attention only to the <a href="http://bit.ly/rhapsodycompendium" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Word</a> of God. Put your trust in the Lord and His unfailing Word. </p>
<p>Set yourself on course to fulfil God’s destiny for your life by making a clear distinction between the world and Christ. Don’t live in this world like a man of this world; Jesus said in John 15:19, <em>“…ye are not of the world….”</em></p>
<p>You’re to live in this world the way Abraham and other heroes of faith in the Bible did. Hebrews 11:13-16 says, <em>“These all…confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had</em> <em>opportunity</em> <em>to have returned. But now they desire a better country, that is,</em> <em>an heavenly</em>*….”* They lived as strangers; they didn’t live as citizens of this world; they didn’t live according to the system of this world. </p>
<p>Refuse to be subject to the principles of this world’s system. Your citizenship is of heaven, not of this world. Philippians 3:20 (MSG) tells us, <em>“But there’s far more to life for us. We’re citizens of high heaven….”</em> Hallelujah!</p>

<p><strong>And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. And a stranger will they not</strong> <strong>follow,</strong> <strong>but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers (John 10:4-5).</strong></p>
<p>Oftentimes, some people hear voices that tell them what to do or about what they’re doing; salvoes of thoughts bombard their minds, especially when they’re on the verge of making very important life-decisions. As a Christian, it’s important that you judge the thoughts and voices you hear with the Word, even when such voices are “familiar voices.” </p>
<p>That the voice you heard, or are hearing, is a familiar one doesn’t necessarily mean it’s God-sent to you. So, be wise, and know the difference between the voice that God sent to you and the voice of a stranger. A stranger will bring you a different message and lead you in the wrong path (See Deuteronomy 13:1-3). </p>
<p>Many times, people wish and hope that a stranger would confirm God’s message to them, thinking it’s more supernatural or spectacular when someone they’ve never known confirms God’s Word to them. But that’s not God’s way of doing things. God is most likely to send to you the one you’ve known, to confirm His Word to your spirit, not the one that you’ve never known. Therefore, always be sure that the voice you’re harkening to or that’s leading you, and confirming your thoughts and prophecy, is the voice of God, or the voice of the one He’s sent to you. </p>
<p>There’s no true child of God that wouldn’t know or recognise the voice of the Holy Spirit. Jesus said, <em>“My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me”</em> (John 10:27).  In our opening scripture, He said, <em>“And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers”</em> (John 10:5). The problem with many is that they ignore His voice. Listen for God’s voice and direction in His Word, because He’ll speak to you through His <a href="http://bit.ly/rhapsodycompendium" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Word</a>, and by the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p><strong>By faith Moses, when he</strong> <strong>was come</strong> <strong>to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter; Choosing rather</strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong>suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season (Hebrews 11:24-25).</strong></p>
<p>Our opening scripture is very instructive: Moses chose rather to undergo the same oppression meted out to God’s people in Egypt, than to enjoy the pleasures of the world for a little while. That was a decision point in his life, and He was guided by the wisdom of God to make the right choice. He esteemed the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt (Hebrews 11:26).</p>
<p>Moses considered the approval and blessing of God in the reproaches of Christ, a far greater treasure than what the world could offer him. Remember, Egypt here is a type of the world; the world and all that it represents. Moreover, Moses was being trained in the palace—to be the Pharaoh—the most “glamorous” position in the earth at the time. He would have been the Pharaoh had he continued in Egypt. But he didn’t let that influence his decision.</p>
<p>Many times, some Christians long for the world and its pleasures, trying to remain a part of the world from which they’ve been severed or separated. You’re not of this world; you must refuse to allow yourself to be entangled in the darkness and failing systems of the world. Having been brought out of the world into Christ, don’t go from Christ to the world; it’s forbidden. </p>
<p>Moses was erudite in all Egyptian education, but when God needed him, he put all that aside and took up the ministry of being a deliverer of God’s people. Paul did the same thing; he said, <em>“Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ”</em> (Philippians 3:8). So, let the <a href="https://rhapsodybible.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wisdom</a> of God guide you to stay in God’s preordained path for your life.</p>

<p><strong>…To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory (Colossians 1:26-27).</strong></p>
<p>Even though listed by many as one of the different religions of the world, Christianity isn’t a religion. Religion describes man’s insatiable desire to reach out to a “God” he believes exists somewhere, and his fear of that “God,” whoever that God might be. Then, his actions portray his thoughts about this “God” whom he’s trying to search out and understand; trying to live his life according to his thinking and perception about this divine being. Christianity, however, is completely different.</p>
<p>In Christianity, man isn’t in search of God; rather, one is brought into a living relationship, union and oneness with God. Christianity is Christ in you, living and working out His righteousness through you. God has given us a triumphant life in Christ Jesus; Christianity is living out that transcendent life of Christ; the unveiling of the living Word in a human life.</p>
<p>Until this becomes a revelation to you, something you know for yourself in a practical way, what you have would be the religiosity of Christian principles, and not Christianity in depth. To be a Christian means you have the very nature of God in your human spirit. It means you’ve become the unveiling of God’s righteousness; the expression and effulgence of His glory. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>The Christian is literally born of God; he’s the Godman; that is, the “mankind” of God; He has and lives the God-life in the earth. In actual sense, he’s a “god.” Psalm 82:6 says, <em>“I have said, Ye are gods</em>*; and* <em>all of you are children of the</em> <em>most High</em>*.”* We’re children of the Most High, because we’re <em>“...born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God”</em> (John 1:13). This is the reason sickness, disease, or infirmity of the body can’t, and shouldn’t be your master. </p>
<p>You’re a partaker of the divine nature; that nature can’t be corrupted or defiled by sickness, disease or anything that’s of darkness, because it’s the very nature of God. This is <a href="http://pastorchrisonline.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christianity</a>: it’s the outworking of divinity—the Christ-life—in you; the practice of the heavenly in the earth! Hallelujah!</p>

<p><strong>But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble (James 4:6).</strong></p>
<p>Whatever God asks you to do, He gives you the grace for it. Romans 12:6-8 says, <em>“Having then</em> <em>gifts</em> <em>differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy… Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching; Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation….”</em> So, we’re given gifts, special abilities, according to the grace that God gives us, showing that there’re different measures of grace, depending on what He tells us to do. </p>
<p>For example, if as a minister, you started out by reaching a certain number of people, God will give you the grace to handle that number. When you’re to reach ten times that number of people, what He does for you is to give you more grace, not more anointing or more power. </p>
<p>There’s nowhere in the Bible He tells us He’ll give us more power or more anointing. What power could be more than the Holy Spirit who already lives in us? He’s the power of God! However, James tells us in our opening verse, <em>“…he giveth more grace….”</em> What is grace? It’s the divine influence on a man’s spirit. It’s the outworking or outward reflection of that inward divine influence: the beauty, ability, perfection, excellence, virtue and glory of divinity in your human spirit. </p>
<p>The problem some have had is the misuse of language. What many call anointing is actually grace, but they don’t realise it. They’ll say, “God has given me a greater anointing,” no; He didn’t! He gave you more grace. That means His power that’s inside you is released more now on the outside, on the basis of His calling on your life. </p>
<p>You can walk in increased grace and accomplish more for the Lord! You can have His beauty, glory, and goodness released in your life in increasing measure, and the scripture tells us how: it’s by your humility, submission to the <a href="http://bit.ly/rhapsodycompendium" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Word</a>, and faithfulness in the things He’s called you to do.</p>

<p><strong>So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it (Isaiah 55:11).</strong></p>
<p>Mark 7 tells the story of a Syrophenician woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit. She cried after the Lord Jesus, imploring Him to heal her daughter, but the Master didn’t respond. She remained persistent, until the disciples were somewhat embarrassed, and besought Jesus to send her away. Jesus then said to her, *“...Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it unto the dogs” (*Mark 7:27). Undaunted by this response, she replied, “… Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs” (Mark 7:28). The woman had great faith, which the Lord commended, saying, <em>“… For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter”</em> (Mark 7:29). </p>
<p>Notice that Jesus didn’t talk to the demon; He didn’t say, “Devil, go out of the girl!” Rather, while talking to the woman, He said, “The demon is gone out of your daughter.” That was all the woman needed—a word from the Master—and she took a hold of that word by faith. </p>
<p>A similar story is that of a nobleman whose son was dying. He came and talked to Jesus and all the Master said was, <em>“Go thy way; thy son liveth….”</em> The Bible says, <em>“…the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way”</em> (John 4:50). That was faith; he took the Master at His Word and went away, expecting a miracle. On his way home, his servants met him and announced to him, <em>“...Thy son liveth”</em> (John 4:51). The Bible says, <em>“Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him”</em> (John 4:52). The man then realised that the miracle took place at the same time Jesus spoke the words of healing. </p>
<p>All you need to come out of any predicament is a word from God: find out what He has said concerning your situation, and take a hold of His Word, standing your ground in faith. When you exercise faith in the Word, it’ll produce results in you and for you—you’ll surely have a <a href="https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/mobile/testify.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">testimony.</a></p>

<p><strong>As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love (John 15:9).</strong></p>
<p>Before His ascension, Jesus said to His disciples, <em>“…continue ye in my love,”</em> as seen in our opening verse. The love of Christ is real; it’s beyond anything in this world. Ephesians 3:17-19 TLB says, <em>“And I pray that Christ will be more and more at home in your hearts, living within you as you trust in him. May your roots go down deep into the soil of God’s</em> <em>marvelous</em> <em>love; and may you be able to feel and understand, as all God’s children should, how long, how wide, how deep, and how high his love really is; and to experience this love for yourselves, though it is so great that you will never see the end of it or fully know or understand it. And so</em> <em>at last</em> <em>you will be filled up with God himself.”</em></p>
<p>Therefore, for us, carrying out the work of the ministry, doing the work of the Lord, is as a result of the compelling force of His love. That way, our service to Him in the ministry of the Gospel is n’t really a job, even though in a sense it’s a job; rather, in reality, it is walking in fellowship with Him, and living in His love. In addition, because you’re living in His love, you’re ever renewed and ever refreshed; your vision is ever expanding, and your life forever moves forward. </p>
<p>In Him, you’re on a journey of ever-increasing glory; you never have to think about staying strong, finishing strong, or hoping that you’ll fulfil your divine destiny; no. Rather, you’re just so fulfilled and thrilled that you’re in Him, and He’s in you; He’s your glory, your success, and your vitality! And all you care about is to know Him more, please Him, and love Him more! Every day becomes another beautiful opportunity to relish His love, enjoy His blessedness, and bask in His glory, with <a href="https://www.christembassy.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more love</a> in your heart for Him. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><strong>So then faith cometh by</strong> <strong>hearing,</strong> <strong>and hearing by the word of God (Romans 10:17).</strong></p>
<p>Once, Simon Peter and his colleagues had rounded off an unsuccessful fishing expedition, and were preparing to anchor their boat when Jesus came by. He asked Peter to move his boat a little further into the sea to enable Him minister to the teeming crowd from there. </p>
<p>Peter obliged, and Jesus preached from Peter’s boat. When Jesus was done ministering, He said to Peter, <em>“…Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.”</em> Notice the underlined portion of Peter’s response; he said, <em>“…Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing:</em> <em>nevertheless</em> <em>at thy</em> <em>word</em> <em>I will let down the net”</em> (Luke 5:4-5). What had happened to Peter? Faith was imparted to him while listening to Jesus preach and teach; it was therefore easy for him to act on the words of the Master. </p>
<p>Even though Peter knew that it wasn’t naturally possible for him and his colleagues to catch any fish in that area, having troubled that part of the sea by their tireless effort all night long, he acted in faith on the words of Jesus, and the result was beyond his imagination. The Bible says, <em>“…they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake. And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they</em> <em>came,</em> <em>and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink”</em> (Luke 5:6-7). </p>
<p>The importance of faith in the life of a Christian can’t be overemphasised. But what’s faith? It’s the response of the human spirit to the Word of God. When you hear the Word of God, and respond accordingly, without any form of doubt or unbelief like Peter exhibited, you’re sure to have a <a href="https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/mobile/testify.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">testimony</a>. So, keep increasing your faith through the Word, and strengthen it by exercising it; that is, by putting the Word to work.</p>

<p><strong>Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works (John 14:10).</strong></p>
<p>The Lord Jesus called the Holy Spirit the Father that dwelt in Him, identifying the Holy Spirit as the One who worked miracles through Him while He walked the earth. Furthermore, in John 8:38, He said, <em>“I speak that which I have seen with my Father….”</em> It’s thus clear that Jesus walked in union with the Father in an extraordinary way. He did nothing without the power of the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p>He said in John 5:19, <em>“…Verily, verily, I say to you, The Son can do nothing by himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.”</em> He was always conscious of His inseparable oneness with the Father. No wonder He was such an outstanding success for us to emulate.  We must walk in union with the Father as He did. </p>
<p>Having received the Holy Spirit, the Father lives in you now, for you’re His temple. So, like Jesus, you’re in the Father, and the Father is in you. Become conscious of this reality. Become conscious that you’re not alone. You don’t have to try to reach out to the Father;  He’s in you. You don’t even need to cry or yell for Him to hear you. Everywhere you go, you go in and with the Father who lives permanently in you. </p>
<p>The Holy Spirit is your Father for real. He knows you more than you know yourself. There’s nothing about you that’s strange to Him. He’s more passionate about your success than you could ever be. Simply accept what He sees you to be, and endorse the picture; then, you’re ready to walk in <a href="http://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">union</a> with Him.</p>
